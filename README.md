# GoBattleSimNode
ðŸŽ® Pokemon GO Raid simulator CLI interface based on GoBattleSim, powered by Node.js 

## Setup

`yarn setup`

## Usage

Running `sim` allows you to sim all Pokemon currently available in Pokemon GO, with all move combinations, against a target raid boss. This will dump a *LARGE* .json output of all sim results versus every combination of defender moves, sorted by defender's fast/charged moves, and most effective counter in order based on TDO (total damage output over a single battle).

`yarn sim <POKEMON NAME>`

The .json produced by this command follows the format below:

```json

    "Ponyta": {
        "ember": {
            "fire blast": [
                {
